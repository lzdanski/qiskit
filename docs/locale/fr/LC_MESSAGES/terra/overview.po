"Terra, the ‘earth’ element, is the foundation on which the rest of Qiskit"
" lies. Terra provides a bedrock for composing quantum programs at the "
"level of circuits and pulses, to optimize them for the constraints of a "
"particular device, and to manage the execution of batches of experiments "
"on remote-access devices. Terra defines the interfaces for a desirable "
"end-user experience, as well as the efficient handling of layers of "
"optimization, pulse scheduling and backend communication."

"A quantum circuit is a model for quantum computing in which a computation"
" is done by performing a sequence of quantum operations (usually gates) "
"on a register of qubits. A quantum circuit usually starts with the qubits"
" in the :math:`|0,…,0>` state (Terra assumes this unless otherwise "
"specified) and these gates evolve the qubits to states that cannot be "
"efficiently represented on a classical computer. To extract information "
"on the state a quantum circuit must have a measurement which maps the "
"outcomes (possible random due to the fundamental nature of quantum "
"systems) to classical registers which can be efficiently represented."

"A major part of research on quantum computing is working out how to run a"
" quantum circuits on real devices.  In these devices, experimental errors"
" and decoherence introduce errors during computation. Thus, to obtain a "
"robust implementation it is essential to reduce the number of gates and "
"the overall running time of the quantum circuit. The transpiler "
"introduces the concept of a pass manager to allow users to explore "
"optimization and find better quantum circuits for their given algorithm. "
"We call it a transpiler as the end result is still a circuit."

msgid ""
"This directory contains tools that make working with Terra simpler. It "
"contains functions that allow the user to execute quantum circuits and "
"not worry about the optimization for a given backend. It also contains a "
"compiler which uses the transpiler to map an array of quantum circuits to"
" a `qobj` (quantum object) which can then be run on a backend. The `qobj`"
" is a convenient representation (currently JSON) of the data that can be "
"easily sent to the remote backends. It also has functions for monitoring "
"jobs, backends, and parallelization of transpilation tasks."

"Once the user has made the `qobj` to run on the backend they need to have"
" a convenient way of working with it. In Terra we do this using three "
"parts: the *provider*, the *backend*, and the *job*."
msgstr ""

#: ../../terra/overview.rst:61
msgid ""
"A *Provider* is an entity that provides access to a group of different "
"backends (for example, backends available through the `IBM Q "
"<https://www.research.ibm.com/ibm-q/technology/devices/>`_). It interacts"
" with those backends to, for example, find out which ones are available, "
"or retrieve an instance of a particular backend."
msgstr ""

#: ../../terra/overview.rst:66
msgid ""
"*Backends* represent either a simulator or a real quantum computer and "
"are responsible for running quantum circuits and returning results. They "
"have a run method which takes in a `qobj` as input and returns a "
"`BaseJob` object. This object allows asynchronous running of jobs for "
"retrieving results from a backend when the job is completed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../terra/overview.rst:71
msgid ""
"*Job* instances can be thought of as the “ticket” for a submitted job. "
"They find out the execution’s state at a given point in time (for "
"example, if the job is queued, running, or has failed) and also allow "
"control over the job."
msgstr ""

#: ../../terra/overview.rst:75
msgid ""
"Once the job has finished Terra allows the results to be obtained from "
"the remote backends using `result = job.result()`.  This result object "
"holds the quantum data and the most common way of interacting with it is "
"by using `result.get_counts(circuit)`. This method allows the user to get"
" the raw counts from the quantum circuit and use them for more analysis "
"with quantum inofrmation tools provided by Terra."

"To perform more advance algorithms and analyzation of the circuits run on"

"quantum information tasks. These include methods to estimate metrics on "
"and generate quantum states, operations, and channels."

msgid ""
"In Terra we have many tools to visualize a quantum circuit. This allows a"
" quick inspection of the quantum circuit to make sure it is what the user"
" wanted to implement. There is a text, python and latex version. Once the"
" circuit has run it is important to be able to view the output. There is "
"a simple function (`plot_histogram`) to plot the results from a quantum "
"circuit including an interactive version. There is also a function "
"`plot_state` and ` plot_bloch_vector` that allow the plotting of a "
"quantum state. These functions are usually only used when using the "
"`statevector_simulator` backend but can also be used on real data after "
"running state tomography experiments (ignis)."
