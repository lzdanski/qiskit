"These tutorials are a set of code examples, `Jupyter Notebooks "
"<http://jupyter.org/>`__ and sample input files that enable experimenting"
" with :ref:`aqua-library`, :ref:`aqua-chemistry`, :ref:`aqua-ai` and :ref"
":`aqua-optimization`.  The programs included demonstrate how to use Aqua "
"and its domain-specific applications programmatically, and also how to "
"extend Aqua with new components.  This feature is particularly useful to "
"quantum researchers who are interested in :ref:`aqua-extending` with new "
"algorithmic components."
