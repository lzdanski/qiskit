"Aqua can be used as a tool to execute `quantum algorithms <#quantum-"
"algorithms.html>`__. With the appropriate input, a quantum algorithm will"
" run on top of the underlying `Terra <https://qiskit.org/terra>`__ "
"platform, which will generate, compile and execute a circuit modeling the"
" input problem. Aqua can also be used as the foundation for domain-"
"specific applications, such as :ref:`aqua-chemistry`, :ref:`aqua-ai` and "
":ref:`aqua-optimization`. This section describes how to install and setup"
" Aqua based on the user's goals."

"At least `Python 3.5 or later <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`__ is "
"needed to use Aqua. In addition, `Jupyter Notebook "
"<https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html>`__ is recommended"
" for interacting with the tutorials. For this reason, we recommend "
"installing the `Anaconda 3 <https://www.anaconda.com/download/>`__ Python"
" distribution, as it comes with all of these dependencies pre-installed."

"Since Aqua is built upon `Terra <https://qiskit.org/terra>`__, you are "

"A different class of users --- namely, quantum researchers and developers"

":ref:`aqua-extending` by providing new components, such as :ref:`quantum-"
"algorithms`, :ref:`optimizers`, :ref:`variational-forms`, :ref:`iqfts`, "
":ref:`oracles` and :ref:`initial-states`. The best way to install Aqua "
"when the goal is to extend its capabilities is by cloning the `Aqua "
