"Qiskit Chemistry is built upon Aqua. Like Aqua, at least `Python 3.5 or "
"later <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`__ is needed to use Qiskit "
"Qiskit Chemistry. In addition, `Jupyter Notebook "
"<https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html>`__ is recommended"
" for interacting with the tutorials. For this reason we recommend "
"installing the `Anaconda 3 <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`__ Python"
" distribution, as it comes with all of these dependencies pre-installed."

"pip will handle all dependencies automatically (including the "

"If your intention is not so much to access Qiskit Chemistry as a tool to "
"perform chemistry computations on a quantum machine, but rather to extend"
" Qiskit Chemistry with new research contributions --- such as new "
"algorithms, algorithm components, input-translation operators or drivers "
"--- then it is advisable to clone both the `Qiskit Chemistry "
"<https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-chemistry>`__ and `Aqua "
"<https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aqua>`__ Git repositories in order to "
"have easier access to the source code of the various components."

"While the logic to interface these drivers is supplied as part of the "
"Qiskit Chemistry installation, the dependent chemistry programs need to "
"be installed separately.  This can be done by following the instructions "
