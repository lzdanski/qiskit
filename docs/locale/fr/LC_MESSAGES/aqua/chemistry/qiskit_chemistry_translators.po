"The translation layer in Qiskit Chemistry maps high-level classically "
"generated input to a qubit operator, which becomes the input to one of "
"Aqua's :ref:`quantum-algorithms`. As part of this layer, Qiskit Chemistry"

"The `Jordan-Wigner transformation "
"<https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01331938>`__, maps spin "
"operators onto fermionic creation and annihilation operators. It was "
"proposed by Ernst Pascual Jordan and Eugene Paul Wigner for one-"
"dimensional lattice models, but now two-dimensional analogues of the "
"transformation have also been created. The Jordan–Wigner transformation "
"is often used to exactly solve 1D spin-chains by transforming the spin "
"operators to fermionic operators and then diagonalizing in the fermionic "
"basis."

"The `parity-mapping transformation <https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08213>`__."
" optimizes encodings of fermionic many-body systems by qubits in the "
"presence of symmetries. Such encodings eliminate redundant degrees of "
"freedom in a way that preserves a simple structure of the system "
"Hamiltonian enabling quantum simulations with fewer qubits."

"Also known as *binary-tree-based qubit mapping*, the `Bravyi-Kitaev "
"transformation "
"<https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003491602962548>`__ "
"is a method of mapping the occupation state of a fermionic system onto "
"qubits. This transformation maps the Hamiltonian of :math:`n` interacting"
" fermions to an :math:`\\mathcal{O}(\\log n)` local Hamiltonian of "
":math:`n` qubits. This is an improvement in locality over the "
"Jordan–Wigner transformation, which results in an :math:`\\mathcal{O}(n)`"
" local qubit Hamiltonian. The Bravyi–Kitaev transformation was proposed "
"by Sergey B. Bravyi and Alexei Yu. Kitaev."

"Bravyi Kitaev Superfast (BKSF) algorithm "
"`<https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5019371>` is a mapping from "
"fermionic operators to qubit operators. BKSF algorithm defines an "
"abstract model where the fermionic modes are mapped to vertices of an "
"interaction graph. The edges of the graph correspond to the interaction "
"between the modes. The graph can be constructed from the Hamiltonian. The"
" simulation is done by putting qubits on the edges of the graph. Each "
"fermionic operator costs :math:`\\mathcal{O}(d)` qubit operations, where "
":math:`d` is the degree of the interaction graph. Nonetheless, the number"
" of qubits required are more than the number of fermionic modes. The BKSF"
" was proposed by Kanav Setia and James D. Whitfield."
