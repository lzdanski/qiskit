"A random distribution is an implementation of a circuit factory that "
"provides a way to construct a quantum circuit to prepare a state which "
"corresponds to a random distribution. More precisely, the resulting state"
" together with an affine map can be used to sample from the considered "
"distribution. The qubits are measured and then mapped to the desired "
"range using the affine map."

"This provides a circuit factory to load a general univariate distribution"
" that is defined by an array of probabilities and the interval of "
"interest. It calls the custom state initialization to prepare a quantum "
"state such that the squared amplitudes correspond to the probabilities. "
"The given lower and upper bound define the range of interest, and the "
"number of qubits specifies the number of grid points in between (=2**n, "
"for n qubits)."

"Provides a circuit factory to build a multivariate uniform distribution. "
