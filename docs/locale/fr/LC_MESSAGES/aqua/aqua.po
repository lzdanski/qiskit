"Problems that can benefit from the power of quantum computing have been "
"identified in numerous domains, such as Chemistry, Artificial "
"Intelligence (AI), Optimization and Finance. Quantum computing, however, "
"requires very specialized skills. To address the needs of the vast "
"population of practitioners who want to use and contribute to quantum "
"computing at various levels of the software stack, we have created :ref"
":`aqua-library` that can be invoked directly or via domain-specific "
"computational applications: :ref:`aqua-chemistry`, :ref:`aqua-ai`, :ref"
":`aqua-optimization` and :ref:`aqua-finance`. Finally, :ref:`aqua-"
"tutorials` is a companion library of notebooks, input files and sample "
"code made available in the form of a `GitHub repository "
"<https://github.com/Qiskit/aqua-tutorials>`__."
