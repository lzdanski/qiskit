"Qiskit Optimization is a set of tools and algorithms that enable "
"experimenting with optimization problems via quantum computing. Aqua "
"Optimization is the only end-to-end software stack that translates "
"optimization-specific problems into inputs for one of the :ref:`quantum-"
"algorithms` in :ref:`aqua-library`, which in turn uses Qiskit Terra for "
"the actual quantum computation on top a quantum simulator or a real "
"quantum hardware device."
